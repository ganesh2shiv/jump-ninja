==========

A simple platform-based 2D game for Android built with AndEngine.

Description
-----------

I did this project for a friend of mine sometime back. I chose AndEngine honestly because I didn't do much research
about all the Game Engines available back then and it turned out to be a mistake.

Those of you who don't know, [AndEngine](https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEngine) is pretty much dead now.

There's really no reason that you should use AndEngine now. There are far better alternatives out there - LibGDX and Unity come to mind.

This project was inspired from [this tutorial](http://www.matim-dev.com/full-game-tutorial---part-1.html).

Build (apk)
-----------

You can download the debug build directly [from here](/apk/app-debug.apk).

**Note: I have tested it on only a couple of devices. So there's no guarantee that it will run on all devices.**
